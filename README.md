# StringManipulation

This program is for different string manipulation and data. 

Case 1 is finding if something is a palindrome 
Ex: "racecar" is true, or "test" is false

Case 2 counts how many times a character occurs in a string, and 4 counts a substring 
Ex: "racecars are cool" has 3 c's

Case 3 removes a character's occurance in a string
Ex: "racecars are cool" with c removed is "raears are ool"
